This repository is devoted to the development of neurodymanics and ODE-based methods for computing several tensor decompositions under constraints.
Actual content:
- CNO for CPD: set of ODE inspired by CNO techniques. The ODE's are solving with several discretization techniques, collaborative aspect is ensured by the use of the well-known Particle Swarn Optimization (PSO) method.
